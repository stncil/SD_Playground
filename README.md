# Introduction
Diffusion-based image synthesis is a recent field with numerous utilities being
published every day. This project aims to showcase the emerging capabilities
surrounding stable diffusion and its customizability using Dreambooth. This is
done with a PyQt-based GUI that displays an intuitive easy-to-use interface that
is also useful for purposes of simple image editing. In addition, with the features
afforded in the tool, it serves as a stepping stone toward understanding the notions
around stable diffusion via its features.

## How to Run:
Run the colab notebook "SD_Backend.ipynb". The last cell in the book will start an ngrok server with an public ip address.
Thereby making the server accessible for clients over the internet.

Copy the ip address and paste it in url.py locally.
Now run the main.py to start the GUI.
From here on follow the _youtube_ demo to look at the various features available in the application.
