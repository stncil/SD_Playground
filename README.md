Diffusion-based image synthesis is a recent field with numerous utilities being
published every day. This project aims to showcase the emerging capabilities
surrounding stable diffusion and its customizability using Dreambooth. This is
done with a PyQt-based GUI that displays an intuitive easy-to-use interface that
is also useful for purposes of simple image editing. In addition, with the features
afforded in the tool, it serves as a stepping stone toward understanding the notions
around stable diffusion via its features.
